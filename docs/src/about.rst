SimpleSR is a small and simple library for Deep Learning based Single Image Super-Resolution.
`Super Resolution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-resolution_imaging>`_ is the field of study for
increasing the resolution of images, while ideally preserving (or generating) finer texture details.

SimpleSR was developed as part of my Undergrad Thesis with the main focus to learn more about Super-Resolution and Deep Learning in general. Additionally I hope this library can serve as a starting point for others to experiment with Super-Resolution.

.. note:: The project is still under active development, things might not work or possibly break in the future. Feel free to open an issue if you encounter a problem.

Source code is available at `github <https://github.com/bw0248/SimpleSR>`_. (not yet public)
